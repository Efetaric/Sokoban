# Sokoban
In this game the user has to push the boxes on their designed spots.
It's pretty intuitive and it also has special features like: teleleportation, experience points and health.

Functions implemented:
When the game is opened two buttons appear: one is for learning how to play the game and one is for starting the game normally;
The user can move the character up, down, left and right;
The character can go only through the free space, it can't go through the outter borders or the obstacles;
The boxes can be pushed by the user only if there's no obstacle blocking the box;
Whenever a box is moved over it's designated area, the user can see how many more he has to push. If every box is pushed a new map is loaded;


Problems:
It has a bit of lag when the map is generated.
