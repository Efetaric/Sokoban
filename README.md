# Sokoban
In this game the user has to push the boxes on their designed spots.
It's pretty intuitive and it also has special features like: teleleportation, experience points and health.

Functions implemented:
The user can only control the character;
Objects are solid, users can't go through the blue boxes.

Problems:
It has a bit of lag when the table loads for the very first time.
